# Sedrick Bouknight
**` Software Developer`**

I'm a software developer focused on the intersection of AI, computer graphics, autonomous systems, XR, and computer vision. I work on building intelligent, interactive systems that blend simulation, perception, and real-time rendering.

My current work includes:

🧠 Developing AI-driven applications for simulation and decision-making

🎮 Exploring real-time graphics and rendering pipelines (OpenGL, Vulkan, DirectX)

🤖 Integrating computer vision into autonomous and robotic systems

🕶️ Prototyping XR interfaces for immersive digital twin experiences

🧱 Bridging the gap between backend simulation engines and reality

I'm especially interested in hybrid workflows where AI and graphics converge—enabling new tools for simulation, training, and visualization.
